Takeaways for success at Turing:
1. Be prepared: schedule/calendar, preview and review lessons, commit time to study and homework.
2. Be willing to ask for help.  It's ok to ask for help.



Two strategies I am committed to trying:
1. Preview lesson before class and begin notes.
2. Practicing challenges and homework until I understand.



Shoutout to someone who has helped me:
1. My brother-in-law Seth.  He is a software developer.  He has supported me every step of the way!
2. My sister Jen.  She is attending a different coding school but we muddle through a lot of things together!
