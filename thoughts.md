Takeaways for success at Turing:
1. Be prepared: schedule/calendar, preview and review lessons, commit time to study and homework.
2. Be willing to ask for help.  It's ok to ask for help.



Two strategies I am committed to trying:
1. Preview lesson before class and begin notes.
2. Practicing challenges and homework until I understand.
